# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

In order to run the server, first create an .env file which includes two enviroment varables:
SECRET_KEY,BASE_URL
then run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

In order to run the server using Docker
run:

```
docker build -t calculator-nodejs-swagger .
docker run -p ${port of your choice }:8080 calculator-nodejs-swagger

```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

```

```
