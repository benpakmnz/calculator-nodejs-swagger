# Node js calculator api (based on swagger generated server stub)

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Core NPM Module

- [x] `dotenv`
- [x] `jsonwebtoken`
- [x] `mongoose-unique-validator`
- [x] `jest`
- [x] `supertest`

### Running the server

```
- create an .env file which includes two enviroment varables: SECRET_JWT_KEY,BASE_URL
- npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

In order to run the server using Docker
run:

```
- docker build -t calculator-nodejs-swagger .
- docker run -p ${port of your choice }:8080 calculator-nodejs-swagger
```

```
This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
```
